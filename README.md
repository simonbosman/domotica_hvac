I had a very old thermostat in my apartment, so when I came home from a day work it was always cold.
So had to fix that.

Bought a jeenode master en a jeenode slave, a nice box, a relay and a temp sensor

I already had an Asus router with a MIPS processor and OpenWrt.

So made the code in C for the Asus router and the code for the two jeenode's in Arduino.

This way I could remote login to my router and set the temperature.
Oh, what I nice feeling to get home when it's all warm and cozy.

See the pics
